                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Alan. I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science student at TU Dublin and working
                    towards a BCs (Hons) degree. It has been an incredible journey to get to this point
                    having completed a PLC in Graphic Design and the Access Programme in TU Dublin in order to get 
                    a place on the Computer Science Programme. I am looking forward to completing my studies,
                    gaining hands on industry experience and furthering my career on this new journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of college life I have a passion for furniture design and manufacturing. It's a very creative
                    and rewarding process. I also enjoy playing tennis, hiking and camping in and around Wicklow, music 
                    production and sound design. During the lockdowns I enrolled on online courses based around Mindfulness 
                    and Meditation which I practice on a daily bases.

                     <p>
                        Java is a language that I feel very comfortable with and have used it
                        in numerous College modules. I built Conway's Game of Life, Kruskals and Prims algorithms,
                        various games and audio visuals with Java. I also completed the Java Foundations Certified 
                        Junior Associate course with Oracle and will enroll in the Java Associate Developer 
                        SE8 course.

                    <p>
                       I very enjoy front-development, the design process. I am proficient in 
                       CSS, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and also have experience with Ruby On Rails and Bootstrap.
                       At present I am working on a Meditation Web App and a Sports Club review website for my portfolio.
                       My plan is to use the Meditation Web App as the basis for my assignment in Mobile Software 
                       Development this semester .

                    <p>
                        I studied Data Exploration in first year and Databases in second year with Oracle 
                        SQL Developer and Data Modeler and found these modules very creative and interesting.
                        I enjoy creating RDBMS's and manipulating and processing data with SQL queries. A recent project 
                        I created and built is a restaraunt booking system database with COVID-19 protocols.

                     Since starting my degree I have acquired experience in Procedural and Object Oriented Programming with Python, C, Java and Prolog.
                     I have also gained a wealth of knowledge in areas such as Program Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, 
                     Software Engineering, Client Serving Programming, Operating Systems, Databases and Data Communications.

                    <p>
                       Design is an area that I have always enjoyed to explore. Whether that is funrniture design,
                       web design, program design, flyers or posters. But the most rewarding design process for me is furniture design 
                       because I am a skilled carpenter and find it easy to visualize a design or concept and bring
                       that idea to life through my own creativity.

                      Music production, sound design and DJ'ing have been a big passion of mine since my early teens. I have enjoyed
                      a small amount of success as a producer and DJ. I have DJ'd at the majority of the major festivals and clubs in Ireland
                      and have been fortunate to DJ, promote and manage stages at festivals abroad in Croatia and Malta.

                       it would be a nice touch to have a dedicated website to present my projects
                       and to allow me showcase some of the skills I have learned throughout my studies 
                       at college.

                            After I completed my Carpentry/Joinery apprenticeship with Storebest Shopfitting I was assigned to Lead Fitter.
                            Then I progressed to Site Foreman, Project Lead and finally ended up in the role of Project Manager. During my 
                            time there I worked and managed projects for Vodafone,  Home Store + More, Circle K, Specsavers, Honda Showrooms 
                            and AGA.

                            During my time working at Storebest I determined the project schedule, which included the sequence of all construction activities.
                            Led a variety of projects from start to finish, including retail, residential and offices.
                            reported the quality of performance on site to all site construction managers.
                            Read and interpreted blueprints and documents to determine project directives.
                            Planned projects by identifying necessary equipment, materials and employees needed to complete the contract within the schedule.
                            Conducted routine quality audits to ensure that work was progressing as per the specifications and initiated corrective actions.
                            Implemented systems to improve process efficiency and reduce the project duration.
